# Compass Tracker

## Overview

Minecraft Spigot 1.16 Plugin.

Plugin sets compass target to closest player in the overworld.
Created to use with my friends to allow us to have more fun playing our speedrun challenges on private server.

## Usage

Need to compile on your own into .jar file, after that everything should be working as intended.
You have to simply take *.jar file and copy and paste it into you're plugins server directory.

After `/reload` of the plugins you should see information in the console:

`[Server thread/INFO]: [CompassNearestPlayerTracker] Loading CompassNearestPlayerTracker v1.0`

`[Server thread/INFO]: [CompassNearestPlayerTracker] Enabling CompassNearestPlayerTracker v1.0`

this informs that plugin is working as intended. Plugin doesn't have any commands as there is no need. Right away after enabling compasses are overwrited.

### Reminder

Plugin developed on JAVA 8
